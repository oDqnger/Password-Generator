# Password-Generator

So recently I've been learning Python so I've decided to make a mini project to test my skills, a password generator.
If you would also like to test your skills by building this project, you can use my code as a solution or as a hint if you're stuck. This project may be difficult for those who are completely new to programming as a whole
as I have experience with other programming languages.

# How to use this project
Before downloading, check if you have python installed in your computer (there might be features in the code that are not supported by python versions below 3). If you have python installed, download the main.py file and
place it anywhere in your computer (make sure you remember where you placed it) Then, go to the command prompt (cmd) and go to the directory in which you placed the main.py file (example: cd Desktop, then cd oDqnger, then cd Programming Projects).
Then to run it, type in your cmd: python main.py

If you encounter any problems along the way, this might be due to the wrong python version your using. If, 'python main.py' doesn't work, try, 'python3 main.py'
